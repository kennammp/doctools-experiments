# Introduction

This demo site was built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It is just a framework used to try out these three tools, so there is no content other than this page and the API specifications.

The Process to build the site is as follows:

## git
Create a repository and clone it to the local machine

## Docusaurus
Docusaurus renders markdown into HTML. It builds a single page application on your local machine, which enables you to see your edits rendered in realtime. The site is configured with the `docusaurus.config.js` as and `sidebars.js` files. This requires some basic Javascript knowledge, especially how to create and edit arrays and objects.

Docusaurus was installed and deployed following [these instructions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment).
